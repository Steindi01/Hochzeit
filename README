Two games for a wedding.

Picture files for the memory have to be in teh same directory of the index.html.
All pictures have to be in the *.jpg format and have to adhere the following naming rules:
- One pair consists of two single *.jpg files
- The first picture of a pair is always an odd number between 1 and 19.
- The picture which belongs to the the first picture is the next even number, so it has to be between 2 and 20.

Example:
- Pair 1: 1.jpg and 2.jpg
- Pair 2: 3.jpg and 3.jpg
... and so on
